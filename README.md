# OpenGL Practice
### Made by following [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject) OpenGL playlist and learnopengl.com

This contains abstraction layers for various OpenGL concepts such as Textures, VAOs, Shaders, ect.

To test out a new concept, create a test object derived from the "Test" class and get cracking.

It will be in the test menu when run and clicking on it will create a new instance of the test.

Sample Tests are in the "Tests" folder under Source.
